# Basic Crowdfunding

## Project Description

**Basic Crowdfunding** is a simple decentralized crowdfunding platform built on Ethereum. It allows creators to launch funding campaigns with specific goals and deadlines, while contributors can support projects with ETH. The smart contract automatically handles fund distribution - if the goal is reached by the deadline, creators can withdraw funds; otherwise, contributors get full refunds.

This project demonstrates core blockchain concepts including time-based logic, fund management, and transparent transactions without intermediaries.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a transparent, trustless crowdfunding solution where:

- **Creators can launch projects** without platform fees or restrictions
- **Contributors support innovation** with guaranteed refunds for failed campaigns  
- **Transparency is built-in** with all transactions visible on the blockchain
- **No intermediaries** are needed, reducing costs and increasing trust
- **Global access** enables anyone to participate regardless of location

We aim to democratize fundraising by removing barriers and providing a fair, secure platform for community-driven project funding.

### Core Functions:

1. **Create Campaign**: `createCampaign(title, description, goal, durationDays)`
2. **Contribute**: `contribute(campaignId)` with ETH value
3. **Claim Funds**: `claimFunds(campaignId)` - withdraw or refund

### Example:
```solidity
// Create a campaign for 10 ETH over 30 days
uint256 campaignId = createCampaign("My Project", "Description", 10 ether, 30);

// Contribute 1 ETH to campaign
contribute(campaignId, {value: 1 ether});

// After deadline: withdraw funds (creator) or get refund (contributor)
claimFunds(campaignId);
```

This simple yet powerful system ensures fair, transparent crowdfunding for all participants.
